################################ Project overview ################################

A full Neural Net made from scratch in python made to make a face recognition NN.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This project was unsuccessful. The network was so slow in training that i realized coding it in raw python alone was a poor choice.
As such I abandoned this project and diverted it into two seperate ones:

Image capturing code: 
The functions written to capture images and save them have been rewritten and improved into its own repo you can find here:
https://github.com/NoahWanless/ImageCapture

Facial recognition:
A project using tensorflow and keras will soon appear that will furfill this functionality using code that will actually run fast.
